# Array Cardio Day 1   
The demo can be viewed [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/JavaScript30/04-Array_Cardio_Day_1/index-START.html).   

I have implemented various functions using Array methods based on [Wes Bos' lecture](https://youtu.be/HB1ZC7czKRs?si=otgzAVtre1yZzq2r).   
However, I did not follow the instructor's solution. In fact, I wrote my own solutions before looking at the video, so all of the solutions are purely original.
   
## Key takeaways
- various Array and string methods
- familiarity especially with the functions [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), [Array.prototype.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), [Array.prototype.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
